# Titan Mission Design Repository 🚀🪐

This repository contains tools, examples, and figures for preliminary mission design
studies to **Saturn and Titan** using patched-conic methods and porkchop plots.

The repo is structured into reusable source modules (`src/`) and runnable examples
(`examples/`) that generate figures in `figures/`. Supporting documentation, such as
presentations and reports, will be placed in `docs/`.
